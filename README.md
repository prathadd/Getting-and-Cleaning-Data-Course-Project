# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The project follows from: https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project 
The R-scrip, run_analysis.R, created for the assignment unravels the following:
1. Download data from the link (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), unzip and save to local directory.
2. Read the relevant data in Objects.
3. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set and add labels.
4. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
7. From the data set in step 6, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject - "tidy_data_set.txt".
